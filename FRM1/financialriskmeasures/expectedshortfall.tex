	\item expected tail loss
	\item tail conditional expectation (TCE)
	\item tail VAR
	\item conditional VAR
	\item tail conditional VAR
	\item worst conditional expectation
	\item and expected shortfall
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Shortfall}
For more on ES and its precursors, see Artzner et. al. (1999, p. 223-224), Acerbi (2004).
The ES is the average of the worst $100\left(1 - \alpha\right)\%$ of losses:
\begin{eqnarray}
	ES &=& \frac{1}{1 - \alpha}\int_{\alpha}^{1}q_{p}dp
\end{eqnarray}
