\chapter{Mortgage Backed Securities}


\section{Agency or Conforming Loans}
\textbf{Agency} or \textbf{conforming} loans are eligible to be securitised by federal agencies.

\section{Non-conforming Loans}
\textbf{Non-agency} or {non-conforming} loans have to be part of \textbf{private-label} securitisation.\\
the relevant loan types include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item jumbos - which are larger in notional than conforming loans but otherwise similar
	\item Alt-A - which deviate from conforming loans in one requirement
	\item subprime - which deviate from conforming loans in several dimensions. About 80\% of subprime loans are \textbf{adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)}
\end{itemize}

\section{Monthly Mortgage Payments}
The present value of the monthly mortgage payments, discounted at the monthly compounded mortgage rate, equals the original amount borrowed.\\
In general, for a monthly payment $X$ for a $T$-year mortgage rate $y$ and an original principal amount or loan balance of $B(0)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
	X\sum_{n = 1}^{12T}\frac{1}{\Big(1 + \frac{y}{12}\Big)^{n}} &=& B(0)
\end{eqnarray}
Defining
\begin{eqnarray}
	y_{0} &=& \frac{y}{12}
\end{eqnarray}
We are getting a geometric series with
\begin{eqnarray}
	r &=& \frac{1}{1 + y_{0}}\\
	a_{0} &=& \frac{X}{1 + y_{0}}\\
		  &=& X\cdot r
\end{eqnarray}
The sum is equal:
\begin{eqnarray}
	S &=& a_{0}\frac{1 - r^{m}}{1 - r} 
\end{eqnarray}
Noting that
\begin{eqnarray}
	1 - r &=& 1 - \frac{1}{1 + y_{0}}\\
		  &=& \frac{1 + y_{0} - 1}{1 + y_{0}}\\
		  &=& \frac{y_{0}}{1+y_{0}}\\
		  &=& r\cdot y_{0}
\end{eqnarray}
we get:
\begin{eqnarray}
	a_{0}\frac{1 - r^{m}}{1 - r} &=& X\cdot r\frac{1 - r^{m}}{r\cdot y_{0}}\\
	&=& \frac{X}{y_{0}}\Big(1 - r^{m}\Big)
\end{eqnarray}
That is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{X}{y_{0}}\Big(1 - r^{m}\Big) &=& B(0)
\end{eqnarray}
or
\begin{eqnarray}
	X &=& B(0)\frac{y_{0}}{1 - r^{m}}
\end{eqnarray}
