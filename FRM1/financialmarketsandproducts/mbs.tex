\section{Agency or Conforming Loans}
\textbf{Agency} or \textbf{conforming} loans are eligible to be securitised by federal agencies.

\section{Non-conforming Loans}
\textbf{Non-agency} or {non-conforming} loans have to be part of \textbf{private-label} securitisation.\\
the relevant loan types include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item jumbos - which are larger in notional than conforming loans but otherwise similar
	\item Alt-A - which deviate from conforming loans in one requirement
	\item subprime - which deviate from conforming loans in several dimensions. About 80\% of subprime loans are \textbf{adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)}
\end{itemize}
