\chapter{FX Risk}

\section{Quotations}
FX rates are listed in 2 ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item direct - the number of units of the domestic currency that could be exchanged for one unit of foreign currency (domestic currency is the base)
	\item indirect - the number of units of the foreign currency could be exchanged for the one unit of the domestic currency (domestic currency is the counter)
\end{itemize}

\section{Net Exposure}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\text{Net Exposure} &=& (\text{FX assets} - \text{FX liabilities})+ (\text{FX bought} - \text{FX sold})\\
	&=& \text{Net foreign assets} - \text{Net FX bought}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{On-Balance Sheet Transactions}
Forward, future and swap transactions are off-balance sheet.

\section{Nominal Interest Rates}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\text{Nominal Interest Rate} &=& \text{Real Interest Rate} + \text{Inflation Rate}
\end{eqnarray}
