\chapter{Insurance Companies}

\section{General}
The role of insurance companies to provide protection against adverse events.\\
The company or individual seeking protection is referred as the \textbf{\color{blue} policyholder}.\\
The policyholder makes regular payments, known as premiums, and receive payments from the insurance company if the specified event occurs.

\subsection{Types of Insurances}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\color{blue}life  insurance}
	\item \textbf{\color{blue}non-life} or \textbf{\color{blue}property-casualty insurance}
	\item \textbf{\color{blue}health insurance}
\end{itemize}
A life insurance contract typically lasts a long time and provides payments to the policyholder's beneficiaries that depend on when the policyholder dies.\\
A property-casualty insurance contract typically lasts one year (although it may be renewed) and provides compensation for losses from accidents.

\subsection{Life Insurance}
Outside the United States, term \textbf{\color{blue}life assurance} is often used to describe a contract where the event being insured against is certain to happen at some future time (e.g., a contract that will pay on the policyholder death).\\
\textbf{\color{blue}Life insurance} is used to describe a contract where the event being insured against may never happen(for example, a contract that provides a payoff in the event of the accidental death of the policyholder).\\
In the United States, all types of life policies are referred to as life insurance.

\subsection{Term Life Insurance}
\textbf{\color{blue}Term} or \textbf{\color{blue}temporary life insurance} lasts predetermined number of years. \textbf{\color{ForestGreen}If the policyholder does not die during the term of the policy, no payments are made by the insurance company}.\\
The face amount of the policy typically stays the same or declines with the passage of time.\\
\textbf{\color{blue}Annual renewable term policy} - the insurance company guaranteed to renew the policy from one year to the next at a rate reflecting the policyholder's age without regard to the policyholder's health.\\
A common reason for term life insurance is a mortgage.

\subsection{Whole Life Insurance}
\textbf{\color{blue}Whole} or \textbf{\color{blue}permanent life insurance} provides protection for the life of the policyholder.\\
In the case of \textbf{\color{ForestGreen}term life insurance, there is no certainty that there will be a payout}, but in the case of \textbf{\color{Mahogany}whole life insurance, a payout is certain to happen provided the policyholder continues to make the agreed premium payments}.\\
Whole life insurance requires considerably higher premiums than term life insurance policies.\\
\textbf{\color{blue}Usually, the payments and the face value of the policy both remain constant through time}.\\
Policyholders can often redeem (surrender) whole life policies early or use the policies as collaterals for loans.\\
When a policyholder wants to redeem a whole life policy early, it is sometimes the case that an investor will buy policy form the policyholder for more than the surrender value offered ba the insurance company. \textbf{\color{blue}The investor will then make premium payments and collect the face value from the insurance company when the policyholder dies}.\\
\textbf{\color{Mahogany}The annual premium for a year can be compared with the cost of providing therm life insurance for that year}.\\
\textbf{\color{blue}There are tax advantages associated with life insurance policies in many countries}. If the policyholder invested the surplus premiums, tax would normally be payable on the income as it was earned. But, when the surplus premiums are invested within the insurance policy, the tax treatment is often better. Tax is deferred, and sometimes the payout to the beneficiaries of life insurance policies is free of income altogether.

\subsubsection{Variable Life Insurance}
\textbf{\color{blue}Variable Live (VL) Insurance} is a form of whole life insurance \textbf{\color{Mahogany}where the surplus premiums are invested in a fund, chosen by the policyholder}. \textbf{\color{ForestGreen}This could be an equity fund, a bond fund, or a money market fund}.\\
Income earned from the investments can sometimes be applied toward the premiums.

\subsubsection{Universal Life}
\textbf{\color{blue}Universal life (UL) insurance} is a form of whole life insurance, in which \textbf{\color{Mahogany}the policyholder can reduce the premium down to a specified minimum without the policy lapsing}.\\
\textbf{\color{ForestGreen}The surplus premiums are invested by the insurance company in fixed income products such as bonds, mortgages, and money market instruments}. The insurance company guarantees a certain minimum return, say 4\%, on these funds.\\
The policyholder can choose between two options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a fixed benefit is paid on death
	\item or the policyholder's beneficiaries receive more than the fixed benefit if the investment return is greater than the guaranteed minimum.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\color{Mahogany}Premiums are lower for the first option}.

\subsubsection{Variable-Universal Life Insurance}
\textbf{\color{blue}Variable-universal life (VUL) insurance} blends the features found in variable and universal life insurances.\\
\textbf{\color{Mahogany}The policyholder can choose between a number of alternatives for the investment of surplus premiums}.\\
The insurance company guarantees a certain minimum death benefit and interest on the investments can sometimes be applied toward premiums.\\
\textbf{\color{ForestGreen}Premiums can be reduced down to a specified minimum without the policy lapsing}.

\subsubsection{Endowment Life Insurance}
\textbf{\color{blue}Endowment life insurance} \textbf{\color{Mahogany}lasts for a specified period and pays a lump sum either when the policyholder dies or at the end of the period, whichever is first}.\\
The amount that is paid out can be specified in advance as the same regardless of whether the policyholder dies or survives to the end of the policy.\\
Sometimes the payout is also made if the policyholder has a critical illness.\\

\textbf{\color{blue}With-profits Endowment Life Insurance} - the insurance company declared periodic bonuses that depend on the performance of the insurance company's investments.\\
These bonuses accumulate to increase the amount paid out to the policyholder, assuming the policyholder lives beyond the end of the life of the policy.\\

\textbf{\color{blue}Unit-linked Endowment Life Insurance} - the amount paid out at maturity depends on the performance of the fund chosen by the policyholder.\\

\textbf{\color{blue}Pure Endowment Life Insurance} has the property that a \textbf{\color{Mahogany}payout occurs only if the policyholder survives to the end of the life of the policy}.
