\section{Definition}

Individual risk premium equals the market premium times $\beta$:

\begin{eqnarray}
E(R_{i}) - R_{f} &=& \beta_{i}(E(R_{m}) - R_{f})
\end{eqnarray}
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $E(R_{i})$ - the (expected) asset return
	\item $R_{f}$ - the risk-free return
	\item $\beta_{i}$ - the sensitivity of the (expected) asset return to the (expected) market return:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\beta_{i} &=& \frac{Cov(R_{i}, R_{m})}{Var(R_{m})} = \rho_{i, m} \frac{\sigma_{i}}{\sigma_{m}}
	\end{eqnarray}
	\item $E(R_{m})$ - the expected market return
	\item $E(R_{m}) - R_{f}$ - the market premium
	\item $E(R_{i}) - R_{f}$ - the risk premium
\end{itemize}

\section{Portfolio possibilities curve (PPC)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The correlation $\rho$ determines the shape of the curve. If the correlation equals to 1, the curve degenerates into a straight line.
	\item The concave segment above the MVP (Minimum Vairance Portfolio) is efficient frontier
	\item The MVP is the furthest to the left
	\item The optimal portfolio maximises the slope of the tangent line from the risk free return to the portfolio possibilities curve. It also has the highest Sharpe ratio.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Capital market line}
The CML is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
	CML: \mathbb{E}[R_{p}] &=& R_{f} + \frac{R_{M} - R_{f}}{\sigma_{M}}\sigma_{p}
\end{eqnarray}
It differs from the efficient frontier in that it contains the risk free asset.\\
The properties of CML:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Every portfolio on the CML is superior to the efficient frontier portfolio before we introduced the risk free rate
	\item The market portfolio is the optimal portfolio
	\item For every portfolio on the CML the Sharpe ratio is the same
\end{enumerate}
That is, \textbf{\color{blue}the CML is the expected return as the function} \textbf{\color{red}of the total risk} \textbf{\color{blue}as represented} \textbf{\color{red}by volatility of the portfolio}.\\
Capital market line represents the decision about the allocation between the market portfolio that is optimal and the risk free asset.

\section{Security market line}
Security market line displays the expected rate of return of an individual security as a function of systematic, non-diversifiable risk.\\
The slope of SML is equal to the market risk premium:
\begin{eqnarray}
E(R_{i}) &=& R_{f} + (E(R_{m}) - R_{f})\beta
\end{eqnarray}
That is \textbf{\color{blue}the SML is the expected return as the function} \textbf{\color{red}of the systematic risk} \textbf{\color{blue}represented} \textbf{\color{red}by $\beta$ of the portfolio}.\\
For the security market line Sharpe ratio is not constant.\\
Security market line accepts any portfolio, but not every portfolio in security market line is efficient.
