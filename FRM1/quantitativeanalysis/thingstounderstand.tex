\chapter{Things to understand}

\begin{itemize}
	\item how variance of the mean and variance is derived
	\item how to generate correlated random numbers
	\item why $R^{2}$ is the squared correlation coefficient between $Y$ and $X$
	\item ways to handle multi-collinearity
	\item Bonferroni method
	\item fit metrics:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item MSE - mean squared error
		\item $R^{2}$
		\item SER - standard error of the regression
		\item SSR - sum of squared residuals
		\item TSS - total sum of squares
		\item ESS - explained sum of squares
	\end{itemize}
	\item Durbin-Watson statistics
	\item the difference between auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation
	\item Box-Pierce Q-statistic
	\item Ljung-Box Q-statistic
