\chapter{Student t-Distribution}
The Student $t$-distribution with $m$ degrees of freedom is defined to be the distribution of
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{Z}{\sqrt{\frac{W}{m}}}
\end{eqnarray}
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Z$ - is a random variable with a standard normal distribution,
	\item $W$ - is a random variable with a chi-squared distribution with $m$ degrees of freedom
	\item ans $Z$ and $W$ are independent.
\end{itemize}
Under the null hypothesis, the $t$-statistic computed using the homoskedasticity-only standard error could be written in this form.
